I left my previous position from Kili Technology on the 30th of November, 2022.
I am joining DNA Script as a Senior Frontend Developer to lead some of the efforts on making the software for the Syntax system, the first DNA synthesizer in the world.
The potential for this company is tremendous, as this could help redefine life science research thanks to the help of RNA, DNA...
